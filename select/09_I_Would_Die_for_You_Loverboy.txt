Little by little you're falling apart
Little by little it's breaking my heart
You're not the person I used to know
I got to have a reason to leave you alone

Little by little it's taken its toll
Little by little you're losing control
It might be easier to walk out of the door
But deep down in my soul I know that you were fighting for

'Cause I would die for you
And there ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
With everyting I have to lose
'Cause I would die for you

Minute by minute it's harder to take
Minute by minute I'm watching you break
Let's get back to what we had before
'Cause in my heart of heart I know that you're fighting for

'Cause I would die for you
And there ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
With everyting I have to lose
'Cause I would die for you
Yes I would die for you
And there ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
With everyting I have to lose
'Cause I would die for you

It's the greatest thing I've ever known
My everything, my heart, my whole
And life wouldn't be worth living on my own, on my own, oh no

'Cause I would die for you (I would die for you)
And there ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
With everyting I have to lose
'Cause I would die for you

I would die for you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do, oh no
'Cause I would die for you (I would die for you), oh baby
Feel lost without you girl
Giving everything you need
Giving every little thing you need
Girl I would die for you baby
