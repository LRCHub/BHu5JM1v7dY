Oh yeah
Rock you baby
My pretty girl, you move so sexy in your skin
Spread your wings for me, let my love come in
My sexy girl, all the world's your stage
You love to feel my passion
You love to feed my rage

Chorus
Give me your faith, you take my hand
You be my girl, I'll be your man
My love's forever, my heart is true
You live for me, I'd die for you
Believe me, baby

Pretty girl, lives inside my head
Like an angel hanging above my bed
I think about you when I'm pacing in my cage
How I loved your eyes, how you loved my evil ways

Chorus
I am love, you are hate
You are laughter, I am rage
My love's forever, my heart is true
You live for me, I'd die for you
Oh yeah, rock it, baby

Pretty girl, I'd protect you from the pain
I will be your sinner, I will be your saint
My sexy girl is so hard to please
She's all I ever wanted, all I ever need

Chorus
You be my girl, I'll be your man
Believe in me, give me your hand
I pull my gun, my aim is true
You'd die for me, 'cause I'd die for you
Oh yeah, rock it baby

You are love, I am hate
You're a sinner and I'm a saint
We are laughter, we are rage
Crime of passion, gonna seal my fate
You're the fire, I'm gasoline
I'm coming on like a war machine
My love is strong, my soul is true
You'd die for me, I'd die for you
