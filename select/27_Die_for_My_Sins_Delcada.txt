And you can laugh when I die for my sins
And you can laugh when I die for my sins
I can't wait, I can't wait
I'm gon' fly, I can't wait

I was like so numb
Everyday I'm fucked up
I'm your angel forever
Will you meet me in heaven?
It's cool, it's nun'
I got so fucked last night
And now I'd rest
But I got you on my mind

I will burn for you
I'll be one with you
I'll be born anew
I'll be born anew

I'm your angel forever
Will you meet me in heaven?
