[00:12.51] Something inside the cards I know is right
[00:18.39] Don't wanna live somebody else's life
[00:23.71] This is what I want to be
[00:26.12] And this is what I give to you
[00:28.10] Because I get it free
[00:29.93] She smiles while I do my time
[00:44.43] 
[00:34.95] I could die for you
[00:40.80] Oh, this life I choose
[00:51.80] 
[00:53.12] I'm here to be your only go-between
[00:58.92] To tell you of the sights these eyes have seen
[01:04.05] What I really want to do is turn it into motion
[01:08.02] Beauty that I can't abuse
[01:10.16] You know that I use my senses to
[01:15.50] You can see that it's only everywhere
[01:21.39] I'd take it all and then I'd find a way to share
[01:45.39] 
[01:26.55] Come along and go along with me
[01:32.28] Wander with me, yo, it's all for free
[01:50.78] 
[01:38.09] I could die for you
[01:42.05] What you wanna do?
[01:43.74] Oh, this life I choose
[01:49.34] I could die for you
[01:53.64] What you wanna do?
[01:55.04] Oh, this life I choose
[02:06.04] 
[02:01.08] Come again and tell me where you wanna go
[02:03.94] What it means to me to be with you alone
[02:06.71] Close the door and no one has to know
[02:09.07] How we are
[02:14.07] 
[02:11.92] Come along and go along with me
[02:17.52] Wander with me, yo, it's all for free
[02:36.02] 
[02:23.34] I could die for you
[02:27.56] What you wanna do?
[02:29.18] Oh, this life I choose
[02:34.89] I could die for you
[02:39.08] What you wanna do?
[02:40.33] Oh, this life I choose
[02:51.33] 
[02:44.62] Make me wanna say
[02:46.28] I could die for you
[02:50.28] What you wanna do?
[02:51.80] Oh, this life I choose
[02:57.20] I could die for you
[03:01.36] What you wanna do?
[03:02.83] Oh, this life I choose
