I walk alone
Through the shadowed night
No place to roam,
No end in sight
I runaway runaway
Nowhere to hide
With darkness closing in on me
Through the endless night

Never gonna find the truth of it
Searching through the end of time
Pain is a part of our history
But tonight just feels all right
(Whoa, whoa)
I would, I would die for you
(Whoa, whoa)
In troubled times we'll make it through
(Whoa, whoa)
I would, I would die for you
(Whoa, whoa)
Yes you know that I would die for you

My heart is black
Filled with silent cries
We can wonder what went wrong
But the pain just grows inside
Trapped in this memory
We live for suffering
All is wasted that we want
And there's no end in sight

Never gonna find the truth of it
Searching through the end of time
Pain is a part of our history
But tonight just feels all right
(Whoa, whoa)
I would, I would die for you
(Whoa, whoa)
In troubled times we'll make it through
(Whoa, whoa)
I would, I would die for you
(Whoa, whoa)
Yes you know that I would die for you

(Whoa, whoa)
I would, I would die for you
(Whoa, whoa)
In troubled times we'll make it through
(Whoa, whoa)
I would, I would die for you
(Whoa, whoa)
In troubled times we'll make it through
(Whoa, whoa)
I would, I would die for you
(Whoa, whoa)
Tonight just feels alright for me and you
Tonight just feels alright for me and you
Tonight just feels alright for me and you
Tonight just feels alright for me and you
