I don't wanna live, baby, but I'm gon' live, baby
Yeah, you say I've been crazy, how you love a sick, baby?
But you know I'd die for you, girl, you know I'd die for you

I don't wanna live, baby, but I'm gon' live, baby
Yeah, you say I've been crazy, how you love a sick, baby?
But you know I'd die for you, girl, you know I'd die for you
I've been on my shit, baby, rounds in the clip, baby
Hoes all on my dick, baby, I don't give a shit, baby
But you know I'd die for you, girl, you know I'd die for you

I know you don't trust me, inside I feel ugly
I've been counting money, now she wanna fuck me
I know you don't trust me, inside I feel ugly
I've been counting money, but she don't really love me
Dope sick in Hollywood, no love, it's all good
Love me baby if you could, I don't know if you should
Yeah, they say I'm bad for you, I don't think I'm bad for you

I don't wanna live, baby, but I'm gon' live, baby
Yeah, you say I've been crazy, how you love a sick, baby?
But you know I'd die for you, girl, you know I'd die for you
I've been on my shit, baby, rounds in the clip, baby
Hoes all on my dick, baby, I don't give a shit, baby
But you know I'd die for you, girl, you know I'd die for you
